Welcome to the sparkling courts of Diamond Valley, where the passion for basketball takes root early! Our Basketball program at the Oilfields Sports Association zooms in on the vibrant community of young hoop enthusiasts aged 6 to 12. Our program is dedicated to fostering a love for the game while nurturing essential life skills in our budding players.

In Diamond Valley, we believe in more than just teaching the fundamentals of basketball. Our tailored programs for kids emphasize teamwork, sportsmanship, and the joy of playing the game. With dedicated coaches who understand the unique needs of young athletes, we create a positive and encouraging environment where every child can grow, both on and off the court.

From the first bounce to the first basket, our sessions are designed to channel the boundless energy and curiosity of our young players. We're not just shaping basketball skills; we're shaping character and confidence that will last a lifetime.

Join us in the Black Diamond Ice Arena, where the courts become a canvas for dreams to take flight. Let the laughter, camaraderie, and the thrill of well-executed play echo through our community. Whether your child is taking their first steps into the world of basketball or already dribbling with delight, we invite families to be a part of the Diamond Valley hoop dreams, where every child can shine like a diamond on the court.
