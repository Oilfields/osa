## Practice Schedules

This years Oilfields Phantoms practice schedule will be:

U7/U9 Thursday at 6:15pm

U11 Tuesdays at 6:15pm

U13 Wednesday at 7:30pm 

U15 Thursday at 7:30pm

U18 Mondays at 8:45pm 

Practices are located at the Scott Seaman Outdoor Rink located behind Oilfields Regional Arena at 611 3rd Street W, Black Diamond. Once players are registered there will also be an opportunity to sign up for some pre-season indoor ice time to get out on the ice before the season starts.

## Game Schedules

The Foothills Recreational Hockey League Coordinators will be meeting at the start of September to create our game schedule. This schedule will be shared with registered players in October. Collectively our goal as league coordinators is to not have that master schedule change once it's been distributed (except for a cancellation or two due to extreme weather conditions, fingers crossed). Games will be played in Black Diamond, Millarville, Priddis, Bragg Creek/Redwood Meadows and possibly Cochrane, Morley and Canmore. The season will start the first week of November and go until the last week of February.
