## Practice Schedules

This years Oilfields Phantoms practice schedule will be: 

U7 & U9 Tuesday 5:45-6:45pm (half ice with rink dividers)

U11 Thursday 5:45-6:45pm

U13 Wednesday 7:45-8:45pm

U15 Monday 8:15-9:15pm

U18 Thursday 8:15-9:15pm 

Practices are located at the Scott Seaman Outdoor Rink located behind Oilfields Regional Arena at 611 3rd Street W, Black Diamond. Once players are registered there will also be an opportunity to sign up for some pre-season indoor ice time to get out on the ice before the season starts.

## Game Schedules

The Foothills Recreational Hockey League Coordinators will be meeting at the start of September to create our game schedule. This schedule will be shared with registered players in October. Collectively our goal as league coordinators is to not have that master schedule change once it's been distributed (except for a cancellation or two due to extreme weather conditions, fingers crossed). Games will be played in Black Diamond, Millarville, Priddis, Bragg Creek/Redwood Meadows and possibly Cochrane, Morley and Canmore. The season will start the first week of November and go until the last week of February.  

## Covid Restrictions

I know some people will be wondering what COVID restrictions will, or will not, be in place before they make the decision to register. At this time there are no COVID restrictions in place. No masks. Change rooms will be open. Spectators will be allowed. Arena staff will be doing additional cleaning of high touch areas and circulating air indoors more frequently. If Provincial Government regulations change at any point during our season we will have to adapt to follow those guidelines as members of Hockey Alberta and also as a facility user group with the Town of Black Diamond.
